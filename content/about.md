## '19 Season Preview

**Draft Location:** Convoy, OH

Notable Rule Changes: *Half-PPR*

## '18 Season Recap

2018 Season Champion DeClayOfGame (Trav) had a decision to make heading into Week 10, sitting one game under 500 at 4-5, Trav saw an opportunity to buy and added extreme depth to his roster by trading for Joe Mixon and Michael Thomas - it cost him 2019 3rd and 4th round picks in the upcoming season.  It was the boost he needed though, finishing the regular season 3-1 while averaging 128.5 points per game.  Trav did not face any challenges in the playoffs, his closest margin of victory was 20 points in the Semifinal.  Briggs had an impressive 8 game winning streak to make it into the playoffs, only to fall to Trav 135 - 102 in the Championship game.

Jordan and Dan faced off in the unspectacular Sack-O.  This was Jordan's second trip in as many years.  He must've used that experience to his advantage, squeaking out a 7 point victory.

2018 also marked the end of an era.  After 7 seasons as commissioner, Kris handed the reigns to Levi as acting commissioner for the 2019 season.  Thank you Kris for your leadership in getting the league up and running.
