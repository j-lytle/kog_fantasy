<h2 id="19-season-preview">&lsquo;19 Season Preview</h2>

<p><strong>Draft Location:</strong> Convoy, OH</p>

<p>Notable Rule Changes: <em>Half-PPR</em></p>

<h2 id="18-season-recap">&lsquo;18 Season Recap</h2>

<p>2018 Season Champion DeClayOfGame (Trav) had a decision to make heading into Week 10, sitting one game under 500 at 4-5, Trav saw an opportunity to buy and added extreme depth to his roster by trading for Joe Mixon and Michael Thomas - it cost him 2019 3rd and 4th round picks in the upcoming season.  It was the boost he needed though, finishing the regular season 3-1 while averaging 128.5 points per game.  Trav did not face any challenges in the playoffs, his closest margin of victory was 20 points in the Semifinal.  Briggs had an impressive 8 game winning streak to make it into the playoffs, only to fall to Trav 135 - 102 in the Championship game.</p>

<p>Jordan and Dan faced off in the unspectacular Sack-O.  This was Jordan&rsquo;s second trip in as many years.  He must&rsquo;ve used that experience to his advantage, squeaking out a 7 point victory.</p>

<p>2018 also marked the end of an era.  After 7 seasons as commissioner, Kris handed the reigns to Levi as acting commissioner for the 2019 season.  Thank you Kris for your leadership in getting the league up and running.</p>

<p><strong>Draft Location:</strong> Columbus, OH</p>

<p>Notable Rule Changes: <em>Future draft picks tradable</em></p>
